## 🌗 Dark and Light Theme

This portfolio supports two visual themes: **Light (White)** and **Dark (Black)**.

* **Light Theme (Default)**
  Uses a white background with black and dark gray accents to keep the design bright, clean, and minimal.

* **Dark Theme**
  Switches the background to a deep black or dark gray, with white or light gray text and accents to reduce eye strain in low-light conditions while maintaining simplicity.

### How it Works

* The CSS includes variables for colors in both themes.
* A toggle button (or system preference detection) switches the theme by adding/removing a `dark-theme` class on the `<body>` element.
* When `dark-theme` is active, the CSS overrides colors accordingly.
* This provides a smooth, user-friendly way to experience the portfolio in both light and dark environments without losing the minimalist style.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (with CSS variables for theming)
* **JavaScript** (optional, for theme toggling)
